BANK LOAN ANALYTICS

Hello Everyone,

I am delighted to share Power BI Dashboard using Bank Loan Analytics Data.

The primary objective of this Bank Loan Analytics project is to gather useful information and improve the way loans are given out. We want to understand the trends, risks, and opportunities related to the loans we have given out, so that we can make smart decisions that will improve our overall performance and reduce any potential risks.
